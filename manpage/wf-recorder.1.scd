# NAME

wf-recorder - A simple screen recording program for wlroots-based compositors

# SYNOPSIS

*wf-recorder* [options...] -f [file]

# OPTIONS
*-a, --audio [DEVICE]*      
	Starts recording the screen with audio.

	*[DEVICE]* argument is optional.
	In case you want to specify the pulseaudio device which will capture the audio,
	you can run this command with the name of that device.
	You can find your device by running: *pactl list sinks | grep Name*

*-c, --codec*      
	Specifies the codec of the video. Supports  GIF output also.

	To modify codec parameters, use *-p <option_name>=<option_value>*

*-d, --device*              
	Selects the device to use when encoding the video      

	Some drivers report support for rgb0 data for vaapi input but really only support yuv.

	Use the -t or --to-yuv option in addition to the vaapi options to convert the 
	data in software, before sending it to the gpu.

*-f <filename>.ext*
	By using the -f option the output file will have the name :filename.ext and the file format 
	will be determined by provided while extension .ext . If the extension .ext provided is not
	recognized by your FFmpeg muxers, the command will fail.

	You can check the muxers that your FFmpeg installation supports by running  : *ffmpeg -muxers*

*-m, --muxer*
	Set the output format to a specific muxer instead of detecting it from the filename.

*-g, --geometry*            
	Selects a specific part of the screen.

*-h, --help*                
	Prints this help screen.

*-l, --log*                 
	Generates a log on the current terminal. Debug purposes.

*-o, --output*              
	Specify the output where the video is to be recorded.

*-p, --codec-param*         
	Change the codec parameters.

	*-p <option_name>=<option_value>*

*-t, to-yuv*
	Use the -t or --to-yuv option in addition to the vaapi options to convert the data in software,
	before sending it to the gpu.
